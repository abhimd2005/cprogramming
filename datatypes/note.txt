C has 4 premitive Datatypes
char
int
float
double

c support two types of qualifiers
signed and unsigned qualifiers
size qualifier, short and long

char:
char type will be of 8bits or 1byte size.
if sign qualifier not specified, then deafault specifier depends on the machine.
ranges:
signed -128 to 127
unsigned 0 - 255

int:
size of an integer depends on the machine and compiler
short int - 2bytes 
long int - 4bytes
by default int will be long int.
TODO: write ranges of all signed, unsigned, long signed and long unsigned

float:
size of a float is 4bytes
size of double is 8 bytes
size of long double is 12bytes
float or double cannot be unsigned.
TODO: write ranges of all signed, unsigned, long signed and long unsigned

Summary:
C has 4 premitive datatypes, such as char, int, float, double, and it has two types of qualifier which are size and sign qualifiers
Sign qualiers are signed and unsigned which can be used for all the 4 datatypes
Size qualifiers are short and long which can be used for int to get long int and short, long can be used for double to get long double

Constants:
Constant is value which cannot be changed.
There are 3 types of Constants
    1. Character Constant
    2. String Constant
    3. Numeric Constant
        a. Integer Constant
            i. Decimal
            ii. Octal
            iii. Hexa decimal
        b. Real Constant

Character Constant:
    A charactes is a single character enclosed with single quote
    examples, 'e', 'A', '9'
    Some invalid character constant are
    "A", 'Hello', '',  y

    Each character is represented by it equivalent ASCII value.
    for example letter 'A' is stored as its equivalent value 65.
    65 is stored in its binary format in memory of 1byte

String Constant:
    A string constant is represented with double quote and will have single or more characters in it.
    A default null character also shown as '\0' is inserted at the end of each constant by the compiler.
    So every string constant will have a null character at the end.

    e.g:
        "ABHISHEK" is stored as below in the memory
        |'A'|'B'|'H'|'I'|'S'|'H'|'E'|'K'|'\0'|, each character's ASCII is stored in binary format.

Integer Constants:
    Integer has 3 types of Constants
    Decimal: numbers system with base 10
    Octal: numbers system with base 8
    Hexadecimal: numbers system with base 16

    Decimal values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    Octal values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    Hexadecimal values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F letters can be either capital or small case

    e.g
    Decimal 75 is represented as 113 in octal and 4B or 4b in Hexadecimal

    Octal number start with 0, that means above number 75 should be give as 0113 in octal
    Hexadecimal number should always start with 0x, that means above number 75 will be given as 0x4B or 0x4b
