c programming is a general purpose low level programming language.
c programs allows users to efficiently control resources of microcontroller/microprocessor
In c programming in one can write instructions in human readable languages and program can be converted into machine language.
The process of converting user readable language into machine language is called as "Compilation process"
below is the basic structure of c program
-----------------------------------------------------
commments
preprocessor directives

int main(void)
{
	local variables
	statements
	...........
	...........
	return 0;
}
func1()
{	
	local variables
	statements
	...........
	...........
}
func2()
{  
	local variables 
	statements
